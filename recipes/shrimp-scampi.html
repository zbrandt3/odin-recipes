        <p>Scampi is a crustacean-based seafood dish, especially featuring langoustine (the Italian name of which gives the dish its name), 
            as well as shrimp or prawns, varying regionally in preparation. The term "scampi" is also used as a style of preparation 
            (of, characteristically, shellfish such as langoustines or shrimp sauteed in olive oil, garlic, and white wine, and garnished with Parmesan cheese and lemon juice).</p>
